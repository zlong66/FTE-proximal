This package implements the method for [Learning causal effect of physical activity distribution: an application
of functional treatment effect estimation with unmeasured confounding](https://doi.org/10.1080/02664763.2025.2474611).


### PAGMM
Simulated datasets are generated using [data_generation_pagmm.R](data_generation_pagmm.R)

The functions for PAGMM are in file [pagmm.R](pagmm.R).

An example of implementing PAGMM is given in [demo_pagmm.R](demo_pagmm.R).


### PMMR
An example of implementing PMMR is given in [demo.Rmd](PMMR/demo.Rmd).
